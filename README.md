To get started with PHP, you'll need three things: a code editor for writing your code, an installed version of PHP, and XAMPP.

We'll be using Visual Studio code in this example, and I'll teach you how to install a version of PHP and XAMPP on your PC.

Go to the PHP website and click on download in the navigation bar. The current version should be at the top.

Click on "Windows downloads," and when it opens, scroll down a little and you should see a section that has "VS16 x64 Thread Safe (2022-May-11 09:29:42)." The section contains a "zip" file below it – click on it and wait for your download to finish.

To run PHP for the web, you will need to install a web server like Apache and a database like MySQL – and both are supported by XAMPP.

XAMPP is a local server that can run smoothly on our personal computer, and is accepted in both Windows and Linux. It also helps you test websites and see if they work before actually publishing them to a web server.

How to Run PHP with XAMPP
To run PHP with XAMPP you will have to go through some steps, and I will break it down so you can understand.

First, open the local storage folder, go to the “xampp” folder and open it. You should see a folder named “htdocs”. Open it then create a new folder in it. In my case I named the folder I created “Demo” (so give your folder the name of your choice).
